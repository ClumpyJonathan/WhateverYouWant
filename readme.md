# WhateverYouWant (WYW) CS:GO cheat

A cheat for the video game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. It has never tested on VAC-secure servers and is probably not safe for use. Named WhateverYouWant since when I asked my friend what to name the cheat, he replied with "whatever you want".

## Features
- Bunnyhop - press Space to automatically jump and gain acceleration
- Triggerbot - hold Mouse4 to automatically shoot when your crosshair is on an enemy
- GlowESP - enemies are automatically highlighted through walls

## Updating Offsets

New updates to the game can break the code since I have not bothered to implement pattern scanning. In this case, you can manually update the code using the offsets from [hazedumper](https://github.com/frk1/hazedumper).
